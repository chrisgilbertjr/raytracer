#### Raytracer ####
A small raytracer built for educational purposes. The raytracer is based on Kevin Suffern's Ray Tracing from the Ground Up. It is written in clean and clear C++. Included is a MS Visual Studio 13 solution (for Windows), and a CMake build step (for Unix) is in the works. I have also included sample images to showcase the basic functionality of the raytracer.

#### Features ####
* A variety of Sampling techniques such as NRooks, Jittered, Multi-Jittered, and Hammersley
* Multiple BRDF's for diffuse and specular lighting
* Collection of materials including Matte, Phong, Emmisive, Reflective, Glossy, and Cook-Torrance
* A few procedural textures such as checkerboard and grid patterns usable on all materials
* Plethora of lights including ambient, area, directional, point, area, and an ambient occluder.
* Array of raytracing techniques such as recursive raytracing and path tracing.
